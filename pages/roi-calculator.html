                <p class="tool-details-text">A salary is normally paid on a regular basis, and the amount normally does
                    not fluctuate based on the quality or quantity of work performed. An employee's salary is commonly
                    defined as an annual figure in an employment contract that is signed upon hiring. Salary can
                    sometimes be accompanied by additional compensation such as goods or services.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tool-details">
                <h3 class="tool-details-heading">Wage</h3>
                <p class="tool-details-text">There are several technical differences between the terms "wage" and
                    "salary." For starters, while the word "salary" is best associated with employee compensation on an
                    annual basis, the word "wage" is best associated with employee compensation based on the number of
                    hours worked multiplied by an hourly rate of pay. Also, wage-earners tend to be non-exempt, which
                    means they are subject to overtime wage regulations set by the government to protect workers. In the
                    U.S., these regulations are part of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Non-exempt employees often
                    receive 1.5 times their pay for any hours they work after surpassing 40 hours a week, also known as
                    overtime pay, and sometimes double (and less commonly triple) their pay if they work on holidays.
                    Salaried employees generally do not receive such benefits; if they work over 40 hours a week or on
                    holiday, they will not be directly financially compensated for doing so. Generally speaking,
                    wage-earners tend to earn less than salaried employees. For instance, a barista that works in a cafe
                    may earn a "wage," while a professional that works in an office setting may earn a "salary." As a
                    result, salaried positions often have a higher perceived status in society.
                    <br>
                    Most salaries and wages are paid periodically, typically monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly,
                    etc. Although it is called a Salary Calculator, wage-earners may still use the calculator to convert
                    amounts.

                <h3 class="tool-details-heading">Miscellaneous Employee Benefits
                </h3>
                <p class="tool-details-text">While salary and wages are important, not all financial benefits from
                    employment come in the form of a paycheck. Salaried employees, and to a lesser extent, wage-earners,
                    typically have other benefits, such as employer-contributed healthcare insurance, payroll taxes
                    (half of the Social Security and Medicare tax in the U.S.) that go towards old age and disability,
                    unemployment tax, employer-contributed retirement plans, paid holiday/vacation days, bonuses,
                    company discounts, and more. Part-time employees are less likely to have these benefits.
                    <br>
                    Miscellaneous employee benefits can be worth a significant amount in terms of monetary value. As
                    such, it is important to consider these benefits as well as the base wage or salary offered when
                    choosing between jobs.

            <div class="tool-details">
                <h3 class="tool-details-heading">Self-employed Contractors</h3>
                <p class="tool-details-text">Self-employed contractors (freelancers who sell their goods and services as
                    sole proprietorships) typically provide their own rates, which can be hourly, daily, or weekly, etc.
                    Also, contractors generally do not have benefits such as paid time off, cheaper health insurance, or
                    any other monetary perks typically associated with full-time employment. As a result, their pay
                    rates should generally be higher (sometimes significantly so) than the salaries of equivalent
                    full-time positions. Nevertheless, rates in the real world are driven by many factors, and it is not
                    rare to see contractors take lower compensation.</p>

            <div class="tool-details">
                <h3 class="tool-details-heading">How Unadjusted and Adjusted Salaries are calculated?</h3>
                <p class="tool-details-text">Using a $30 hourly rate, an average of eight hours worked each day, and 260
                    working days a year (52 weeks multiplied by 5 working days a week), the annual unadjusted salary can
                    be calculated as:
                <p class="formula tool-details-text">
                    $30 × 8 × (260) = $62,400
                </p>
                <p class="tool-details-text">
                    As can be seen, the hourly rate is multiplied by the number of working days a year (unadjusted) and
                    subsequently multiplied by the number of hours in a working day. The adjusted annual salary can be
                    calculated as:
                </p>

                <p class="formula tool-details-text">
                    $30 × 8 × (260 - 25) = $56,400
                </p>

                <p class="tool-details-text">
                    Using 10 holidays and 15 paid vacation days a year, subtract these non-working days from the total
                    number of working days a year.

                    All bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, and quarterly figures are derived from these annual
                    calculations.
                    It is important to make the distinction between bi-weekly, which happens every two weeks, and
                    semi-monthly, which occurs twice per month, usually on the fifteenth and final day of the month.</p>

                <h3 class="tool-details-heading">How to Increase Salary</h3>
                <p class="tool-details-text">There are very few people in the world who wouldn't welcome a higher
                    salary, and there are a myriad of ways in which a person can try to do so. While it is definitely
                    easier said than done, it is certainly possible.

                <ul class="tools-details-list">
                    <li><strong>Education — </strong>Statistics have shown that the higher the level of education a
                        person attains, the
                        higher
                        their average lifetime earnings. However, becoming more educated for a higher salary does not
                        imply
                        that everyone should immediately go out and receive a higher degree. Proof of knowledge can come
                        in
                        many other different forms. For one, qualifications or certifications are a less time-consuming
                        and
                        financially significant undertaking that can still result in a salary increase. Simply
                        increasing
                        relevant knowledge or expertise that pertains to a niche profession or industry can increase
                        salary.
                        This may involve staying up-to-date on current events within the niche by attending relevant
                        conferences or spending leisure time reading on the subject.

                    <li>
                        <strong> Experience —</strong> The more experience a person has within any niche industry or
                        profession, the more
                        likely
                        their salary will increase over the years, given that they stay within the industry. This may be
                        due
                        to several reasons; for one, it shows that a person has enough interest in the industry to stay
                        within it long-term. Secondly, by lasting within the industry long enough, there is sufficient
                        proof
                        that they are probably somewhat skilled. Employers see these as good signs and are more willing
                        to
                        increase a worker's salary.

                    <li>
                        <strong> Network — </strong>For many niche professions or industries, there are professional
                        organizations or trade
                        associations that help their members network. These organizations try to connect their members
                        with
                        other members who may share the same profession and goals, or work in the same industry, which
                        can
                        potentially lead to job opportunities that can improve the salary.

                        <strong>Performance Reviews — </strong>Most employers give out annual performance reviews to
                        their employees. Most
                        performance reviews usually involve a conversation between manager and employee regarding the
                        past
                        year and how the employee performed, the direction of the employee's role moving forward,
                        including
                        any new responsibilities they may have, and constructive criticism on what they could do better,
                        among other things. Annual reviews that are, for the most part, positive are generally followed
                        by
                        an annual pay raise. If no raise is given, even after a glowing review, it may be in the
                        employee's
                        best interest to ask for a salary increase or begin considering other employment options.

                        <strong>Negotiate — </strong> If a performance review was mostly positive, but no mention of a
                        pay raise is made, it
                        may
                        be worth considering approaching the employer to attempt to negotiate a pay raise. Highlight
                        achievements, particularly those that may have been mentioned in a performance review, such as
                        meeting or exceeding certain sales goals, taking on a number of new job responsibilities, or
                        anything valuable that was contributed to the employer that might warrant a raise. When starting
                        a
                        new job, it is also important to negotiate a higher salary, if possible.

                        <strong>Change jobs — </strong>People that are stuck in a career they dislike with no salary
                        increase and who have
                        exhausted all other options to try to increase their salary may want to consider changing jobs.
                        It
                        is fairly common for some people to have a 10% or more increase in salary from doing so.
